# **locations_get**
> Locations locations_get(pretty=pretty, depth=depth, x_contract_number=x_contract_number)

Get Locations

Retrieves the available physical locations where you can deploy cloud resources in a VDC. 

 A location is identified by a combination of the following characters: 

 * a two-character **regionId**, which represents a country (example: 'de') 

 * a three-character **locationId**, which represents a city. The 'locationId' is typically based on the IATA code of the city's airport (example: 'txl'). 

 >Note that 'locations' are read-only and cannot be changed.

* Basic Authentication (BasicAuthentication):
* Api Key Authentication (TokenAuthentication):
