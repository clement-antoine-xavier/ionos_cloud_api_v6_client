# **backupunits_ssourl_get**
> BackupUnitSSO backupunits_ssourl_get(backupunit_id, pretty=pretty, x_contract_number=x_contract_number)

Retrieve BU single sign-on URLs

Retrieve a single sign-on URL for the specified backup unit.

### Example

* Basic Authentication (BasicAuthentication):
* Api Key Authentication (TokenAuthentication):

```python
import openapi_client
from openapi_client.models.backup_unit_sso import BackupUnitSSO
from openapi_client.rest import ApiException
from pprint import pprint

# Defining the host is optional and defaults to https://api.ionos.com/cloudapi/v6
# See configuration.py for a list of all supported configuration parameters.
configuration = openapi_client.Configuration(
    host = "https://api.ionos.com/cloudapi/v6"
)

# The client must configure the authentication and authorization parameters
# in accordance with the API server security policy.
# Examples for each auth method are provided below, use the example that
# satisfies your auth use case.

# Configure HTTP basic authorization: BasicAuthentication
configuration = openapi_client.Configuration(
    username = os.environ["USERNAME"],
    password = os.environ["PASSWORD"]
)

# Configure API key authorization: TokenAuthentication
configuration.api_key['TokenAuthentication'] = os.environ["API_KEY"]

# Uncomment below to setup prefix (e.g. Bearer) for API key, if needed
# configuration.api_key_prefix['TokenAuthentication'] = 'Bearer'

# Enter a context with an instance of the API client
with openapi_client.ApiClient(configuration) as api_client:
    # Create an instance of the API class
    api_instance = openapi_client.BackupServiceApi(api_client)
    backupunit_id = 'backupunit_id_example' # str | The unique ID of the backup unit.
    pretty = True # bool | Controls whether the response is pretty-printed (with indentations and new lines). (optional) (default to True)
    x_contract_number = 56 # int | Users with multiple contracts must provide the contract number, for which all API requests are to be executed. (optional)

    try:
        # Retrieve BU single sign-on URLs
        api_response = api_instance.backupunits_ssourl_get(backupunit_id, pretty=pretty, x_contract_number=x_contract_number)
        print("The response of BackupServiceApi->backupunits_ssourl_get:\n")
        pprint(api_response)
    except Exception as e:
        print("Exception when calling BackupServiceApi->backupunits_ssourl_get: %s\n" % e)
```
