# **um_users_owns_get**
> ResourcesUsers um_users_owns_get(user_id, pretty=pretty, depth=depth, x_contract_number=x_contract_number)

Retrieve user resources by user ID

Retrieve own resources of the user by user ID. The user ID is in the response body when the user is created, and in the list of the users, returned by GET.

### Example

* Basic Authentication (BasicAuthentication):
* Api Key Authentication (TokenAuthentication):

```python
