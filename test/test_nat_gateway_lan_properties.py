    CLOUD API

     IONOS Enterprise-grade Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) solutions can be managed through the Cloud API, in addition or as an alternative to the \"Data Center Designer\" (DCD) browser-based tool.    Both methods employ consistent concepts and features, deliver similar power and flexibility, and can be used to perform a multitude of management tasks, including adding servers, volumes, configuring networks, and so on.
